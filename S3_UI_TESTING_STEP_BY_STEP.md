# S3 Integration - Step-by-Step UI Testing Guide

## üéØ Goal
Test if files are uploading to AWS S3 (cloud storage) instead of local storage.

---

## ‚úÖ Pre-Check: Is S3 Enabled?

### Step 1: Check Server Logs

Look at your backend server terminal (the one showing `[0]` messages).

**‚úÖ S3 IS ENABLED if you see:**
```
‚úÖ S3 Client initialized successfully
üì¶ Using S3 Bucket: your-bucket-name
üåç Region: us-east-1
```

**‚ùå S3 IS NOT ENABLED if you see:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Using local disk storage for folder: employees (S3 not configured)
‚ö†Ô∏è  Using local disk storage for folder: onboarding (S3 not configured)
```

**If NOT enabled**: See the "How to Enable S3" section at the bottom.

2. Look for an upload request (usually POST to `/api/employees/...`)
3. Click on that request
4. Look at the **Response** tab

### Step 7: Check the Response

**‚úÖ S3 IS WORKING if you see a URL like:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "fileUrl": "https://your-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/employees/1728901234-abc123def-photo.jpg"
}
```

**‚ùå S3 IS NOT WORKING if you see:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "fileUrl": "/uploads/employees/photo-1728901234.jpg"
}
```

### Step 8: Verify Photo Displays

---

## üß™ Test 3: Verify File Access (Signed URLs)

### Purpose
If your S3 bucket is **private** (recommended for security), files are accessed via temporary signed URLs.

### Step 1: Upload a Document
1. Follow Test 1 or Test 2 above
2. Upload any file

### Step 2: View the File
1. After upload, try to **view or download** the file from the UI
2. Click on the file thumbnail or "View" button

### Step 3: Inspect the URL
1. Right-click on the displayed image/file
2. Select **"Copy Image Address"** or **"Copy Link Address"**
3. Paste it in a text editor

**‚úÖ Signed URL looks like:**
```
https://your-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/employees/file.jpg?
X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&
X-Amz-Credential=...&
X-Amz-Date=...&
X-Amz-Expires=3600&
X-Amz-Signature=...&
X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host
```

Notice the query parameters (`?X-Amz-...`) - these make it a signed URL.

### Step 4: Test URL Expiration (Optional)
1. Copy the signed URL
2. Paste it in a new browser tab
3. The file should open successfully
4. **Wait 1 hour** (or the configured expiration time)
5. Refresh the same URL
6. You should get an **"Access Denied"** error
7. This is correct behavior for security!

2. Click **"Upload Logo"**
3. Select an image file
4. Upload should complete

### Step 3: Verify in Preview
1. The logo should appear in the **offer letter preview**
2. Check DevTools Network tab for S3 URL

### Step 4: Verify in AWS
1. AWS Console ‚Üí S3 ‚Üí Your Bucket
2. Look in **"assets/"** or **"documents/"** folder
3. Logo file should be there

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem 1: "Upload failed" error in UI

**Check:**
1. Browser Console (F12) - any errors?
2. Backend logs - what does it say?
3. Network tab - what's the response?

**Common Causes:**
- S3 not configured (check server logs for warnings)
- Invalid AWS credentials
- Wrong bucket name
- No internet connection

### Problem 2: Upload succeeds but photo doesn't display

**Check:**
1. Right-click image ‚Üí Inspect
2. Look at the `src` attribute
3. Copy the URL and paste in new tab
4. Does it load?

**If Access Denied:**
- Bucket might be private (good!)
- System should generate signed URLs automatically
- Check backend logs for signed URL generation

### Problem 3: Files go to local storage instead of S3

**Verify:**
1. Backend logs show: `‚ö†Ô∏è Using local disk storage`
2. File URLs start with `/uploads/...`

**Solution:**
- S3 is not enabled
- See "How to Enable S3" section below

---

## üîß How to Enable S3

If S3 is not enabled, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Update .env File

Open `.env` file and add/update:

```env
# Enable S3
USE_S3=true

# AWS Credentials (replace with your actual values)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_S3_BUCKET=your-actual-bucket-name

# Optional (has defaults)
AWS_S3_ACL=private
AWS_S3_SIGNED_URL_EXPIRATION=3600
```

### Step 2: Get AWS Credentials

**If you don't have them:**

1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/
2. Click **Users** ‚Üí **Add users**
3. Username: `hr-system-s3-user`
4. Access type: **Programmatic access**
5. Permissions: **AmazonS3FullAccess**
6. Create user
7. **Copy Access Key ID and Secret Access Key**
8. Paste them in `.env` file

### Step 3: Create S3 Bucket

**If you don't have a bucket:**

1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/
2. Click **Create bucket**
3. Bucket name: `your-company-hr-files` (must be unique globally)
4. Region: `us-east-1` (or your preferred region)
5. **Block all public access**: Keep checked ‚úÖ
6. Click **Create bucket**
7. Copy bucket name to `.env` file

### Step 4: Restart Server

```bash
# Stop servers (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Verify

Look for in backend logs:
```
‚úÖ S3 Client initialized successfully
üì¶ Using S3 Bucket: your-bucket-name
```

Now go back to Test 1 and try uploading!

## üéì Understanding the Flow

### Upload Process:

```
1. User selects file in browser
   ‚Üì
2. Frontend sends file to backend API
   ‚Üì
3. Backend receives file via multer middleware
   ‚Üì
4. Middleware checks: Is S3 enabled?
   ‚îú‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Upload to S3
   ‚îî‚îÄ No ‚Üí Save to local ./uploads/
   ‚Üì
5. Return file URL to frontend
   ‚Üì
6. Frontend displays file using URL
   ‚Üì
7. Backend saves URL to MongoDB
```

### File Access:

**Public Buckets:**
- Direct URL: `https://bucket.s3.region.amazonaws.com/key`
- Anyone can access
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not recommended for sensitive HR documents

**Private Buckets (Recommended):**
- Signed URL: `https://bucket.s3...?X-Amz-Signature=...`
- Temporary access (default: 1 hour)
- Secure and expires automatically

## üìû Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check server logs** - most helpful for diagnosing issues
2. **Check browser console** - shows frontend errors
3. **Check network tab** - shows API requests/responses
4. **Check AWS CloudWatch** - shows S3 access logs (advanced)
5. **Run test script**: `node test-s3-upload.js`

**Common Issues:**
- `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`: Backend not running
- `404 Not Found`: Wrong API endpoint
- `403 Forbidden`: AWS permission issue
- `Access Denied`: Wrong bucket name or region
- `SignatureDoesNotMatch`: Wrong AWS credentials
