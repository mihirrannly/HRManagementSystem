## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend
- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/employees/anniversaries`
- **File:** `server/routes/employees.js` (line 46-120)
- **Authentication:** Required (all authenticated users)
- **Response:** JSON with `thisMonth` and `upcoming` arrays

### Frontend
- **Files Modified:**
  - `client/src/pages/Dashboard/EmployeeDashboard.jsx`
  - `client/src/pages/Dashboard/Dashboard.jsx`
- **State:** `anniversaries` object with `thisMonth` and `upcoming`
- **API Call:** `fetchAnniversaries()` on component mount
- **Display:** Conditional rendering based on data availability

## 📍 Location on Dashboard

The anniversary cards appear:
1. Below the stat cards (Attendance Rate, Available Leaves, etc.)
2. Above the main content tabs/charts
3. Side by side on desktop (stacked on mobile)

## 🎯 Business Logic

### Inclusion Criteria
An employee appears in the anniversary cards if:
1. ✅ Account is active (`employmentInfo.isActive = true`)
2. ✅ Has a valid joining date (`employmentInfo.dateOfJoining` exists)
3. ✅ Has completed at least 1 year of service
4. ✅ Anniversary falls in current month (This Month's) OR next month (Upcoming)

### Exclusions
- New employees with less than 1 year of service
- Inactive/terminated employees
- Employees without joining dates

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   ./start-servers.sh
   ```

2. **Login with any credentials**

3. **Navigate to Dashboard** (default landing page)

4. **Scroll down** past the welcome section and stat cards

5. **View anniversary cards** (if any anniversaries exist)

## 📊 Sample Data

For testing, if you have an employee named "Rajesh Kumar" with:
- Joining Date: Any October date in a previous year (e.g., Oct 15, 2020)
- Status: Active

He will appear in "This Month's Anniversaries" when viewing in October with the correct years of service calculated.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Automatic calculation of years of service
- ✅ Beautiful gradient backgrounds (pink for current, blue for upcoming)
- ✅ Avatar with employee initials
- ✅ Hover effects and animations
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Clean, modern UI
- ✅ Real-time data from database
- ✅ No manual updates needed

## 🎉 Status: COMPLETE

All requirements from the user request have been fully implemented and are ready to use!

**The anniversary cards are now live on the dashboard with real data! 🎊**
