# AWS S3 Integration - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

Your HR Management system now has **complete AWS S3 integration** for cloud-based file storage. All document and image uploads can now be stored in AWS S3 buckets instead of local storage.

---

## 📦 New Dependencies Installed

```json
{
  "aws-sdk": "AWS SDK v2 (for compatibility)",
  "@aws-sdk/client-s3": "AWS SDK v3 S3 Client",
  "@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner": "Generate signed URLs for private files",
  "multer-s3": "Multer storage engine for S3"
}
```

---

## 🗂️ Files Created

### 1. Configuration File
- **`server/config/s3.js`**
  - S3 client initialization
  - Configuration validation
  - Checks for required environment variables
  - Graceful fallback if S3 not configured

### 2. S3 Service
- **`server/services/s3Service.js`**
  - `uploadToS3()` - Upload files programmatically
  - `getSignedUrlForS3Object()` - Generate temporary access URLs
  - `deleteFromS3()` - Delete files from S3
  - `fileExistsInS3()` - Check file existence
  - `getS3FileMetadata()` - Get file information
  - Helper functions for key management

### 3. S3 Upload Middleware
- **`server/middleware/s3Upload.js`**
  - Intelligent storage selection (S3 or local)
  - Pre-configured upload instances:
    - `uploads.employee` - Employee documents
    - `uploads.onboarding` - Onboarding files
    - `uploads.candidate` - Candidate portal uploads
    - `uploads.profile` - Profile images
    - `uploads.document` - General documents
    - `uploads.asset` - Asset files
  - Custom file filters for different file types
  - `getFileUrl()` helper - Works for both S3 and local

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Automatic Storage Selection**
The system automatically:
- Uses S3 if `USE_S3=true` and credentials are configured
- Falls back to local storage if S3 is not configured
- No code changes needed when switching between storage modes

### 2. **Zero Breaking Changes**
- All existing endpoints continue to work
- File URLs work for both S3 and local storage
- Frontend code requires no changes

### 3. **Organized S3 Structure**
Files are automatically organized in S3:
```
your-bucket/
├── employees/         # Employee documents
├── onboarding/        # Onboarding files
├── profiles/          # Profile images
├── documents/         # General documents
├── assets/            # Asset files
└── esignature-templates/  # E-signature templates
```

### 4. **Security Built-in**
- Private bucket support
- Signed URLs for secure access
- Configurable URL expiration
- IAM-based access control

### 5. **Flexible Configuration**
- Enable/disable with a single flag
- Works in development (local) and production (S3)
- Easy credential rotation

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Use S3 (Recommended for Production)

1. **Set up AWS S3** (see [S3_QUICK_SETUP.md](./S3_QUICK_SETUP.md))

2. **Configure .env**:
```env
USE_S3=true
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
```

3. **Restart server**:
```bash
npm run server
```

4. **Verify in logs**:
```
✅ S3 Client initialized successfully
📦 Using S3 Bucket: your-bucket-name
```

### Option 2: Use Local Storage (Default)

Keep `USE_S3=false` or don't set S3 variables. Files will be stored locally in `uploads/` directory.

---

## 📊 What Changed for Each Upload Type

### Employee Documents
- **Before**: Stored in `uploads/employees/`
- **After**: Stored in S3 bucket under `employees/` or local if S3 disabled
- **Endpoint**: `/api/employees/:id/upload` (unchanged)

### Onboarding Documents
- **Before**: Stored in `uploads/onboarding/`
- **After**: Stored in S3 bucket under `onboarding/` or local if S3 disabled
- **Endpoints**: 
  - `/api/onboarding/:id/documents` (unchanged)
  - `/api/candidate-portal/:id/upload-image` (unchanged)

### E-Signature Templates
- **Before**: Stored in `uploads/esignature_templates/`
- **After**: Stored in S3 bucket under `esignature-templates/` or local if S3 disabled
- **Endpoint**: `/api/esignature/templates/upload` (unchanged)

---

## 💡 Code Examples

### Upload Files (No changes needed!)
```javascript
// Frontend - works exactly the same
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('document', file);

await axios.post('/api/employees/upload', formData);
// File automatically goes to S3 or local storage based on config
```

### Backend - Access File URL
```javascript
const { getFileUrl } = require('../middleware/s3Upload');

router.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), async (req, res) => {
  const fileUrl = getFileUrl(req.file);
  // Returns S3 URL or local path automatically
  
  await Employee.updateOne(
    { _id: employeeId },
    { documentUrl: fileUrl }
  );
});
```

### Advanced - Generate Signed URL
```javascript
const { getSignedUrlForS3Object } = require('../services/s3Service');

// For private files, generate temporary access URL
const signedUrl = await getSignedUrlForS3Object('employees/document.pdf', 3600);
// URL expires in 1 hour
```

## 🔒 Security Recommendations

1. **Keep Bucket Private**
   - Always use `Block all public access`
   - Use signed URLs for file access

2. **Use Minimal IAM Permissions**
   - Grant only necessary S3 permissions
   - See guide for custom IAM policy

3. **Rotate Credentials**
   - Rotate AWS keys every 90 days
   - Use AWS Secrets Manager in production (advanced)

4. **Enable Encryption**
   - Enable bucket encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS)

5. **Monitor Usage**
   - Set up AWS CloudWatch alerts
   - Monitor S3 costs

## 💰 Cost Considerations

For a typical HR system with 500 employees:
- **Storage**: ~5GB = $0.12/month
- **Transfers**: Minimal for internal use
- **Requests**: Negligible cost

**Total estimated cost**: < $1/month for small/medium companies

See [S3_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](./S3_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed pricing.

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Local Storage (Default)
```bash
# .env
USE_S3=false

npm run server
# Upload a file via any upload endpoint
# File should be in uploads/ folder
```

### Test S3 Storage
```bash
# .env
USE_S3=true
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_S3_BUCKET=your-bucket

npm run server
# Upload a file via any upload endpoint
# Check AWS S3 Console - file should be there
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "S3 is not configured"
**Solution**: 
1. Set `USE_S3=true` in .env
2. Add all AWS credentials
3. Restart server

### Issue: Files not uploading to S3
**Check**:
1. AWS credentials are correct
2. Bucket name is correct
3. IAM user has S3 permissions
4. Region matches bucket region

### Issue: Can't access uploaded files
**Solution**:
- If bucket is private, use `getSignedUrlForS3Object()` to generate access URLs
- Or set `AWS_S3_ACL=public-read` (not recommended for sensitive data)

See [S3_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](./S3_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed troubleshooting.
