# Punch Records Update Fix

## ✅ Issue Fixed

**Problem:** When a new punch was added via webhook, the card at the top showed the correct latest punch time, but the punch records table below wasn't updating to show the new punch time and total hours weren't calculated correctly.

**Root Cause:** The Mongoose pre-save hook wasn't being triggered properly when the `punchRecords` array was modified, causing the `checkIn`, `checkOut`, and `totalHours` fields to not recalculate.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Webhook Route (`server/routes/webhook.js`)
**Line 172** - Added `markModified()` to ensure pre-save hook triggers

**Before:**
```javascript
attendance.punchRecords.push(punchRecord);
await attendance.save();
```

**After:**
```javascript
attendance.punchRecords.push(punchRecord);
// Mark punchRecords as modified to ensure pre-save hook runs
attendance.markModified('punchRecords');
await attendance.save();
```

**Why:** Mongoose sometimes doesn't detect changes to array elements. The `markModified()` method explicitly tells Mongoose that the array has changed, ensuring the pre-save hook runs.

### 2. Attendance Model (`server/models/Attendance.js`)
**Lines 206-267** - Enhanced pre-save hook with better logic and debugging

**Improvements:**
- Added console logging to track when pre-save hook runs
- Improved comparison logic for check-in/check-out times
- Added logging for calculated total hours
- Better handling of time comparisons using `getTime()`

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// More robust time comparison
const newCheckInTime = new Date(firstInPunch.time);
const existingCheckInTime = this.checkIn?.time ? new Date(this.checkIn.time) : null;

// Always update if it's earlier or if no checkIn exists or if times are different
if (!existingCheckInTime || newCheckInTime < existingCheckInTime || newCheckInTime.getTime() !== existingCheckInTime.getTime()) {
  // Update check-in...
  console.log(`✅ Updated check-in to: ${new Date(firstInPunch.time).toISOString()}`);
}
```

### 3. Frontend UI (`client/src/pages/Attendance/Attendance.jsx`)
**Lines 2401-2433** - Added manual refresh button

**New Feature:**
- "Refresh Data" button with loading state
- Located in the top-right of the punch records section
- Provides immediate refresh without waiting for 30-second auto-refresh
- Shows "Refreshing..." when loading

**Button Features:**
- Disabled when no date is selected or already loading
- Shows success toast message when clicked
- Styled to match the page theme (glassmorphism effect)
- Icon animates on hover

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### When a New Punch Arrives:

1. **Webhook receives punch data** from biometric device
2. **Adds punch to `punchRecords` array**
3. **Calls `markModified('punchRecords')`** to mark array as changed
4. **Saves attendance record** which triggers pre-save hook
5. **Pre-save hook runs and:**
   - Filters IN punches, finds first one
   - Filters OUT punches, finds last one
   - Updates `checkIn` and `checkOut` fields
   - Calculates `totalHours` between them
   - Logs all actions to console
6. **Frontend auto-refreshes** (every 30 seconds) or user clicks "Refresh Data"
7. **Table updates** with new punch and correct total hours

### Manual Refresh:

Users can now click the "Refresh Data" button to immediately see updates instead of waiting for the 30-second auto-refresh.

## 📊 Example Scenario

**Kunika's punches:**
```
09:00 AM - IN
12:00 PM - OUT
12:30 PM - IN
12:24 PM - OUT  ← NEW PUNCH (latest)
```

**Before Fix:**
- Card shows: 12:24 PM (correct, from `latestPunchInfo`)
- Table shows: Not updated (missing new punch)
- Total hours: Incorrect

**After Fix:**
- Card shows: 12:24 PM (from `latestPunchInfo`)
- Table shows: 12:24 PM (from updated `record.lastPunchOut`)
- Total hours: Correctly calculated (09:00 AM to 12:24 PM = 3.4h)

## 🔍 Debugging

The enhanced logging will show in server console:

```
🔄 Pre-save hook: Processing 4 punch records
✅ Updated check-in to: 2025-10-13T09:00:00.000Z
✅ Updated check-out to: 2025-10-13T12:24:00.000Z
⏱️  Total hours calculated: 3.40h (from 09:00:00 to 12:24:00)
✅ Punch OUT saved for CODR001 at 12:24 | Total punches: 4 | Hours in premise: 3.4h
```

This helps verify:
- Pre-save hook is running
- Times are being updated correctly
- Total hours are calculated correctly

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **`server/routes/webhook.js`** - Added `markModified()` call
2. **`server/models/Attendance.js`** - Enhanced pre-save hook with logging
3. **`client/src/pages/Attendance/Attendance.jsx`** - Added manual refresh button

## ✅ Benefits

1. **Immediate Recalculation:** New punches trigger instant recalculation
2. **Accurate Data:** Check-in, check-out, and total hours always correct
3. **Manual Refresh:** Users don't have to wait for auto-refresh
4. **Better Debugging:** Console logs help identify issues
5. **Robust Logic:** Proper array modification detection

## 🧪 Testing

To verify the fix:

1. **Add a new punch via webhook** (biometric device)
2. **Check server console** for pre-save hook logs
3. **Wait up to 30 seconds** for auto-refresh OR click "Refresh Data"
4. **Verify card and table** both show correct latest punch time
5. **Check total hours** are calculated correctly

Expected Console Output:
```
🔄 Pre-save hook: Processing X punch records
✅ Updated check-in to: [time]
✅ Updated check-out to: [time]
⏱️  Total hours calculated: Xh (from [time] to [time])
```

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### Manual Refresh Button
- **Location:** Top-right of punch records section
- **Style:** Glassmorphism effect matching page theme
- **States:** 
  - Normal: "Refresh Data" with refresh icon
  - Loading: "Refreshing..." with disabled state
  - Disabled: When no date selected
- **Feedback:** Toast message on click

## 📌 Important Notes

1. **Auto-refresh still works:** Every 30 seconds
2. **Manual refresh available:** For immediate updates
3. **Pre-save hook always runs:** When `markModified()` is called
4. **Logging is temporary:** Can be removed after verification
5. **No data loss:** All punch records still preserved
