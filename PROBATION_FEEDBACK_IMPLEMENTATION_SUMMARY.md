## 🔄 How It Works

### Automatic Daily Process

```
Every Day at 9:00 AM
        ↓
Scheduler checks for employees completing 90 days
        ↓
For each completing employee:
        ↓
    1. Create ProbationFeedback record
    2. Send in-app notification to employee
    3. Send in-app notification to manager
    4. Send email to employee
    5. Send email to manager
    6. Mark notifications as sent
        ↓
Every Day at 10:00 AM
        ↓
Check for pending feedbacks older than 3 days
        ↓
Send reminder notifications (once per recipient)
```

### User Flow

```
EMPLOYEE:
Receives notification → Opens form → Completes 4 sections → Submits
                                                               ↓
MANAGER:                                                       ↓
Receives notification ← ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ┘
        ↓
Opens assessment → Completes 5 sections → Makes recommendation → Submits
                                                                     ↓
HR:                                                                  ↓
Receives notification ← ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ┘
        ↓
Reviews both feedbacks → Makes final decision → Submits
                                                   ↓
Employee receives final decision notification
```

   employmentInfo.dateOfJoining = new Date('2025-07-17')
   ```

2. **Trigger Scheduler** (automatic on server start):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Check Results**:
   - Database: `db.probationfeedbacks.find()`
   - Notifications: Check in-app notifications
   - Emails: Check inbox (if email configured)

4. **Test Forms**:
   - Login as employee → Navigate to feedback form
   - Fill and submit
   - Login as manager → Navigate to assessment form
   - Fill and submit
   - Login as HR → Review both feedbacks

## 💡 Best Practices

### System Management

1. **Monitor Daily**: Check scheduler logs for successful runs
2. **Review Weekly**: Look at pending feedbacks and completion rates
3. **Update Monthly**: Review and update email templates if needed
4. **Audit Quarterly**: Check system effectiveness and gather feedback

### Data Quality

1. **Accurate Joining Dates**: Ensure employee joining dates are correct
2. **Manager Assignment**: Keep reporting relationships updated
3. **Email Addresses**: Maintain current email addresses
4. **Status Updates**: Mark employees inactive when they exit

### User Experience

1. **Communication**: Inform users about the system
2. **Training**: Provide guidance on completing forms
3. **Support**: Be available for questions
4. **Feedback**: Gather and act on user feedback

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Fixed Probation Period**: Currently hardcoded to 90 days (can be made configurable)
2. **No Auto-Save**: Forms don't auto-save (users must complete in one session)
3. **Single Manager**: Assumes one reporting manager (doesn't handle matrix reporting)
4. **Email Dependency**: Email notifications require SMTP configuration
5. **No Mobile App**: Web-only (responsive design works on mobile browsers)

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Getting Help

1. **Documentation**: Check `PROBATION_FEEDBACK_SYSTEM.md` for details
2. **Quick Start**: See `PROBATION_FEEDBACK_QUICK_START.md` for common tasks
3. **Logs**: Review server console for error messages
4. **Database**: Query MongoDB for data verification

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **No feedbacks created**
   - Check employee joining dates
   - Verify scheduler is running
   - Check server logs for errors

2. **Emails not sending**
   - Verify EMAIL_* environment variables
   - Test email service separately
   - Check email service logs

3. **Notifications not appearing**
   - Verify notification creation in database
   - Check user is logged in
   - Test notification API directly
