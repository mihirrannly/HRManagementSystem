# Recent Exits Dashboard Feature

## Overview
Added a new dashboard card that displays the exit status of employees who left the organization in the last two months.

## Implementation Date
October 13, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend API Endpoint
**File:** `server/routes/exitManagement.js`

#### New Endpoint: `/api/exit-management/recent-exits`
- **Method:** GET
- **Access:** Private (HR, Admin, Manager)
- **Description:** Fetches employees who left in the last 2 months with detailed exit status

#### Response Structure:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 5,
  "exits": [
    {
      "_id": "exit_id",
      "employeeId": "CODR001",
      "employeeName": "John Doe",
      "designation": "Senior Developer",
      "department": "Engineering",
      "location": "Mumbai",
      "exitType": "resignation",
      "lastWorkingDate": "2025-09-15T00:00:00.000Z",
      "status": "completed",
      "reasonForLeaving": "Better opportunity",
      "clearanceStatus": {
        "itClearance": "completed",
        "hrClearance": "completed",
        "financeClearance": "completed",
        "managerClearance": "completed",
        "adminClearance": "completed"
      },
      "completionPercentage": 100,
      "daysSinceExit": 28
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Features:
- Filters exits by `lastWorkingDate` in the last 2 months
- Populates employee, department, and reporting manager details
- Calculates completion percentage based on exit checklist
- Calculates days since exit
- Provides clearance status summary for all 5 clearance types

#### Helper Function:
- `calculateCompletionPercentage(exit)`: Calculates the percentage of completed exit checklist items

### 2. Frontend Dashboard Component
**File:** `client/src/pages/Dashboard/Dashboard.jsx`

#### Changes in `EmployeeOverviewSection`:

1. **New State:**
   - Added `recentExits` state to store recent exit data

2. **API Integration:**
   - Added API call to `/exit-management/recent-exits` endpoint
   - Integrated into existing `fetchOverviewData()` function

3. **New UI Card:**
   - Displays after the main employee overview grid
   - Shows only when there are recent exits (`recentExits.length > 0`)
   - Clean, professional card design matching existing dashboard style

#### Card Features:
- **Header Section:**
  - Title: "Recent Exits (Last 2 Months)"
  - Description explaining the content

- **Employee Information:**
  - Employee name (bold)
  - Employee ID and designation
  - Department and location

- **Exit Status:**
  - Color-coded status chip:
    - Green for "completed"
    - Orange for "pending_approval"
    - Blue for "in_progress"
    - Gray for other statuses
  - Last working day with formatted date
  - Days since exit

- **Additional Details:**
  - Exit type (resignation, termination, etc.)
  - Completion percentage
  - Clearance status chips for all 5 clearance types:
    - IT Clearance
    - HR Clearance
    - Finance Clearance
    - Manager Clearance
    - Admin Clearance

- **Visual Design:**
  - Each clearance status has color-coded chips:
    - Green: completed
    - Blue: in_progress
    - Orange: pending
  - Clean dividers between entries
  - Responsive layout
  - Scrollable list for multiple exits

## Exit Status Types
The system tracks these exit statuses:
- `initiated` - Exit process just started
- `in_progress` - Exit process is ongoing
- `pending_clearance` - Waiting for clearances
- `pending_approval` - Waiting for final approval
- `completed` - All exit formalities completed
- `cancelled` - Exit process cancelled

## Clearance Types Tracked
1. **IT Clearance:** Laptop return, email deactivation, system access revocation
2. **HR Clearance:** ID card return, exit interview, documentation
3. **Finance Clearance:** Final settlement, expense claims, loan recovery
4. **Manager Clearance:** Work handover, knowledge transfer, project closure
5. **Admin Clearance:** Office keys, parking pass, desk clearance

## Testing

### Backend Testing
```bash
# Test the API endpoint (requires authentication)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/exit-management/recent-exits
```

### Frontend Testing
1. Navigate to the Dashboard
2. Scroll down to the "Employee Overview" section
3. If there are exits in the last 2 months, you'll see the "Recent Exits" card below the main grid
4. Verify that:
   - Employee details are displayed correctly
   - Exit status is color-coded properly
   - Clearance statuses are shown with appropriate colors
   - Dates are formatted correctly
   - Completion percentage is calculated and displayed

## Benefits
1. **Visibility:** Provides immediate visibility of recent departures
2. **Status Tracking:** Shows the current status of exit formalities
3. **Compliance:** Helps ensure all exit procedures are completed
4. **Historical Record:** Maintains a 2-month rolling window of exits
5. **Actionable Insights:** Highlights pending clearances and incomplete exits

## Future Enhancements
Consider these improvements:
1. Add filters by department or status
2. Make the time period (2 months) configurable
3. Add click-through to detailed exit record
4. Export functionality for exit reports
5. Email notifications for pending clearances
6. Analytics on exit reasons and patterns

## Technical Notes
- Uses existing permission system (MODULES.EXIT_MANAGEMENT, ACTIONS.READ)
- Leverages Material-UI components for consistent design
- Responsive layout works on mobile and desktop
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Error handling with graceful degradation

## Files Modified
1. `server/routes/exitManagement.js` - Added new endpoint and helper function
2. `client/src/pages/Dashboard/Dashboard.jsx` - Added UI card and API integration

## Dependencies
- No new dependencies added
- Uses existing authentication and permission middleware
- Uses existing Material-UI components

## Security
- Requires authentication
- Uses existing permission checks
- Only authorized roles (HR, Admin, Manager) can access
- Data sanitization through Mongoose schemas

## Performance
- Efficient query with indexed fields (lastWorkingDate)
- Pagination not needed (typically small result set for 2 months)
- Lean queries for better performance
- Minimal frontend re-renders
