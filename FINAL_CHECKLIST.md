# Final Checklist - Late Employees Report

## ‚úÖ The Code IS in Your Application

Verified at these locations:
- Line 370: Button with "Late Employees Report" text
- Line 888-1005: Complete dialog implementation
- Backend: `/server/routes/attendance.js` line 2620-2979

## üöÄ TO SEE IT, FOLLOW THESE EXACT STEPS:

### Step 1: Check Your URL
Your app is running on: **http://localhost:5175**

Go to: **http://localhost:5175/reports**

### Step 2: Check Your User Role

**CRITICAL**: Only these roles can see Reports:
- ‚úÖ admin
- ‚úÖ hr
- ‚úÖ manager
- ‚ùå employee (regular users)

To check your role:
1. Press F12 (open browser console)
2. Copy and paste this:
```javascript
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'))?.role
```
3. Press Enter
4. It will show your role

### Step 3: What You'll See Based on Role

#### If you DON'T have permission:
You'll see a message:
```
"You don't have permission to view reports."
```

#### If you DO have permission:
You'll see the full Reports page with THREE buttons at the top right:
```
[‚ö†Ô∏è Late Employees Report]  [Export]  [Refresh]
```

### Step 4: Hard Refresh
After confirming you're on the right page:
- Press `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- OR `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)

## üîß Quick Role Fix

If you need to test with an admin account:
1. Log out from current account
2. Log in with an admin/HR/manager account
3. Navigate to Reports page

OR if you're developing, you can temporarily change your role in the database.

## üì∏ Debug Information Needed

If you still don't see it, please provide:

1. **Your user role** (from console):
```javascript
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'))?.role
```

2. **Current URL** you're viewing

3. **Screenshot** of the Reports page

4. **Console errors** (F12 ‚Üí Console tab, any red errors?)

## üéØ Expected Behavior

### When button IS visible:
1. Orange "Late Employees Report" button at top right
2. Click it ‚Üí Dialog opens
3. Select Excel or PDF format
4. Choose date range
5. Click "Download Report"
6. File downloads

### When button is NOT visible:
Most likely reason: You don't have admin/hr/manager role

## ‚úÖ Verification Commands

Run these in your project directory:

```bash
# Verify the button code exists
grep -n "Late Employees Report" client/src/pages/Reports/Reports.jsx

# Should show 3 lines:
# 370: Late Employees Report (button text)
# 888: Comment
# 898: Dialog title

# Verify backend endpoint exists
grep -n "late-employees-report" server/routes/attendance.js

# Should show the route at line 2620
```

Both commands should return results, confirming the code is there.
