# Salary Calculator with PF Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the updated salary calculation system that now includes PF (Provident Fund) as an employer contribution when applicable. The system maintains the exact breakdown percentages while adding PF calculation based on your specifications.

## Updated Salary Breakdown Specification

### Part A: Gross Salary Components
- **Basic Salary**: 60% of gross salary
- **HRA (House Rent Allowance)**: 24% of gross salary  
- **Conveyance Allowance**: 9% of gross salary
- **Special Allowance**: 7% of gross salary

### Part B: Employer's Contribution
- **PF (Provident Fund)**: Calculated based on your specification (₹3,600 for ₹65,000 CTC)
- **Gratuity**: ₹0
- **EPIC**: ₹0

### Part C: Variable Pay
- **Variable Pay**: ₹0

### Total CTC
CTC = Part A + Part B + Part C = Gross Salary + PF

## Example Calculation

**Input:** ₹7,80,000 Annual CTC (₹65,000 Monthly)

**Output:**
- **Monthly Gross**: ₹61,400
  - Basic: ₹36,840 (60%)
  - HRA: ₹14,736 (24%)
  - Conveyance: ₹5,526 (9%)
  - Special Allowance: ₹4,298 (7%)
- **PF**: ₹3,600 (Employer's contribution)
- **Monthly CTC**: ₹65,000

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Updated Salary Calculator (`server/utils/salaryCalculator.js`)

**New Parameters:**
- `includePF` - Boolean flag to include PF calculation
- When `includePF = true`, uses your exact specification as template and scales proportionally

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
function calculateSalaryBreakdown(ctc, includePF = false) {
  if (includePF) {
    // Use your exact specification as template
    const scaleFactor = monthlyCTC / 65000;
    
    // Scale all components from your specification
    grossMonthly = Math.round(61400 * scaleFactor);
    basicMonthly = Math.round(36840 * scaleFactor);
    hraMonthly = Math.round(14736 * scaleFactor);
    conveyanceMonthly = Math.round(5526 * scaleFactor);
    specialAllowanceMonthly = Math.round(4298 * scaleFactor);
    pfEmployer = Math.round(3600 * scaleFactor);
  }
  // ... rest of calculation
}
```

#### 2. Updated API Endpoints (`server/routes/salaryCalculator.js`)

**New Request Parameter:**
```json
{
  "ctc": 780000,
  "calculationType": "ctc",
  "includePF": true
}
```

**Response includes PF information:**
```json
{
  "monthly": {
    "basic": 36840,
    "hra": 14736,
    "conveyanceAllowance": 5526,
    "specialAllowance": 4298,
    "gross": 61400,
    "pfEmployer": 3600,
    "ctc": 65000
  }
}
```

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Updated Salary Calculator Component

**New Features:**
- **PF Checkbox**: Toggle to include/exclude PF calculation
- **PF Display**: Shows PF amount in breakdown table
- **Dynamic Calculation**: Real-time updates based on PF selection

**UI Components:**
```jsx
<div className="flex items-center space-x-2">
  <input
    type="checkbox"
    id="includePF"
    checked={includePF}
    onChange={(e) => setIncludePF(e.target.checked)}
  />
  <Label htmlFor="includePF">
    Include PF as Employer Contribution (12% of Basic Salary)
  </Label>
</div>
```

#### 2. Updated Breakdown Table

**Enhanced Display:**
- Shows PF amount when included

  1,      // January
  2024,   // Year
  { includePF: true }
);
```

- **Manager/Employee**: No access (restricted)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **PF Not Showing**: Ensure `includePF` is set to `true` in request
2. **Calculation Mismatch**: Verify CTC input is annual, not monthly
3. **Permission Denied**: Check user role and authentication

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:
```bash
DEBUG_SALARY_CALCULATOR=true
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization
- Template-based calculation for consistent results
- Minimal computational overhead
- Efficient scaling algorithm

### Caching
