## Troubleshooting

### If you don't see the new sections:

1. **Check Console Logs:**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12 or Right-click ‚Üí Inspect)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for these logs:
     - üîç Fetching detailed reports...
     - üìÖ Fetching attendance from...
     - üìä Received attendance records: X
     - ‚úÖ Reports data updated

2. **Hard Refresh:**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows/Linux)
   - Or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
   - This clears cache and reloads

3. **Check Tab:**
   - Make sure you're on the "Time" tab (has clock icon)
   - Count the tabs: About, Profile, Job, Education, Experience, **Time**, Documents

4. **Scroll Down:**
   - The new section is below the existing "Leave Balance" section
   - Look for "Detailed Analytics & Reports" divider

5. **Check for Data:**
   - The charts need attendance data to display
   - If you have no attendance records, you'll see "No data available" messages
   - But the metric cards should still show (with 0 values)

### If Data Shows as 0:

This is normal if:
- You haven't checked in/out in the last 30 days
- The attendance system was recently set up
- You're a new employee

The system will populate with real data as you use the attendance system.

## Expected Behavior

- **With Data:** Charts and metrics populate with your actual attendance records
- **Without Data:** Empty state messages appear, but the UI structure is visible
- **Loading:** Brief loading state when first opening the tab

## Console Debugging

Check the console for these messages:
- ‚úÖ **Success:** "Reports data updated" - Everything is working
- ‚ùå **Error:** "Error fetching detailed reports" - API issue

If you see errors, check:
1. Backend server is running
2. You're logged in correctly
3. Your employee profile exists
