# Dashboard Role-Based Visibility Update

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

### What Was Changed

The dashboard now implements role-based visibility for sensitive HR sections. The following cards are now **hidden from regular employees** and only visible to **Admin** and **HR** users:

1. **Exits Card** - Shows recent employee exits (last 2 months)
2. **Onboarding Card** - Shows new employees being onboarded (last 1 month)
3. **On Probation Card** - Shows employees currently on probation period

### Files Modified

1. **`client/src/pages/Dashboard/EmployeeDashboard.jsx`**
   - Updated `EmployeeOverviewSection` component to accept `userRole` prop
   - Added role checking logic: `isAdminOrHR = userRole === 'admin' || userRole === 'hr'`
   - Wrapped Exits, Onboarding, and Probation cards with conditional rendering
   - Updated component call to pass `userRole={user?.role}`

2. **`client/src/pages/Dashboard/Dashboard.jsx`**
   - Applied same changes as EmployeeDashboard
   - Updated `EmployeeOverviewSection` component
   - Implemented role-based conditional rendering
   - Updated component call to pass user role

### How It Works

**Before:**
```jsx
// All cards visible to everyone
<Grid item xs={12} md={3}>
  <Card>
    <CardContent>
      Exits Card Content
    </CardContent>
  </Card>
</Grid>
```

**After:**
```jsx
// Cards only visible to Admin/HR
{isAdminOrHR && (
  <Grid item xs={12} md={3}>
    <Card>
      <CardContent>
        Exits Card Content
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  </Grid>
)}
```

### User Experience

#### For Regular Employees:
- ‚ùå **Hidden**: Exits, Onboarding, On Probation cards

- Clean, focused dashboard showing only relevant information

#### For Admin & HR Users:

- Complete visibility of team status

### Cards Still Visible to All Users:

1. **Birthdays** üéÇ - Upcoming employee birthdays
2. **Work Anniversaries** üéâ - Employee work anniversaries

### Technical Details

**Role Detection:**
```javascript
const isAdminOrHR = userRole === 'admin' || userRole === 'hr';
```

**Supported Roles:**
- `admin` - Full access (sees all cards)
- `hr` - HR access (sees all cards)
- `employee` - Limited access (sensitive cards hidden)
- `manager` - Limited access (sensitive cards hidden)

### Testing Instructions
