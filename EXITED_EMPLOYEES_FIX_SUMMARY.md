# ✅ Exited Employees Fix - Complete

## 🎯 Problem
Once an employee was exited through Exit Management, they were still appearing in employee lists throughout the application.

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### Changed File:
- **`server/routes/employees.js`** - Updated GET `/api/employees` endpoint

### What Changed:
```javascript
// BEFORE: Showed ALL employees (active + inactive) by default
let filter = {};
if (req.query.isActive !== undefined) {
  filter['employmentInfo.isActive'] = req.query.isActive === 'true';
}

// AFTER: Shows only ACTIVE employees by default ✅
let filter = {};
if (req.query.isActive !== undefined) {
  filter['employmentInfo.isActive'] = req.query.isActive === 'true';
} else {
  filter['employmentInfo.isActive'] = true; // ← DEFAULT TO ACTIVE
}
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### Exit Process Flow:
```
1. Create Exit Record
   ↓
2. Complete Clearances (IT, HR, Finance, Manager, Admin)
   ↓
3. Return Assets
   ↓
4. Exit Interview & Survey
   ↓
5. Approve Exit ← This sets employmentInfo.isActive = false
   ↓
6. Employee automatically removed from all lists ✅
```

### What Happens When Exit is Approved:
```javascript
// In exitManagement.js - Line 1354
employee.employmentInfo.isActive = false;
employee.employmentInfo.terminationDate = exitRecord.lastWorkingDate;
employee.employmentInfo.terminationReason = exitRecord.reasonForLeaving;
await employee.save();
```
