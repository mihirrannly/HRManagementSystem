# Announcement Update & Reaction Visibility Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Announcement Update Not Working
**Problem**: When editing an announcement, the changes weren't being saved properly, especially for poll options.

**Root Cause**: The backend PUT endpoint (`/announcements/:id`) was missing support for updating poll options.

**Solution**: 
- Added `isPoll` to the list of allowed updates in the backend
- Implemented smart poll option updating that preserves existing votes when option text matches
- Added better error handling and logging in the frontend

**Files Changed**:
- `server/routes/announcements.js` - Added poll update logic
- `client/src/pages/Announcements/AnnouncementManagement.jsx` - Enhanced error handling

### 2. ✅ Reaction Visibility - Who Gave What Reaction
**Problem**: Users could see reaction counts but couldn't see who reacted with what reaction type.

**Solution**: 
- Added expandable reaction details showing name, employee ID, and reaction type
- Implemented similar UI pattern as the poll voter details
- Added click-to-expand functionality with ▲/▼ indicators
- Shows emoji, person icon, and user details for each reaction

**Features**:
- Click on "X reactions" to see who reacted
- Visual indicators: 👍 (Like), ❤️ (Love), 🎉 (Celebrate), 🤝 (Support), 💡 (Insightful)
- Shows full name, employee ID, and reaction type
- Works on all pages:
  - Announcement Management (HR/Admin)
  - Dashboard (All users)
  - Employee Dashboard (All users)

**Files Changed**:
- `client/src/pages/Announcements/AnnouncementManagement.jsx`
- `client/src/pages/Dashboard/Dashboard.jsx`
- `client/src/pages/Dashboard/EmployeeDashboard.jsx`

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Update Endpoint Enhancement
```javascript
// Added isPoll to allowed updates
const allowedUpdates = [
  'title', 'content', 'priority', 'category', 'targetAudience',
  'targetDepartments', 'targetLocations', 'targetRoles',
  'startDate', 'endDate', 'isPinned', 'isActive', 'isPoll'
];

// Smart poll option updating - preserves votes
if (req.body.isPoll && req.body.pollOptions) {
  const existingOptions = announcement.pollOptions || [];
  const newOptions = req.body.pollOptions.map((option) => {
    const existing = existingOptions.find(opt => opt.option === option);
    if (existing) {
      return existing; // Preserve votes
    }
    return { option, votes: [] }; // New option
  });
  announcement.pollOptions = newOptions;
}
```

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Added State Management for Reactions
```javascript
const [expandedReactions, setExpandedReactions] = useState(null);
const [reactionDetails, setReactionDetails] = useState({});
```

#### 2. Fetch Reaction Details
```javascript
const fetchReactionDetailsForAnnouncements = async (announcementsList) => {
  const details = {};
  for (const announcement of announcementsList) {
    if (announcement.reactions && announcement.reactions.length > 0) {
      const reactionPromises = announcement.reactions.map(async (reaction) => {
        const userResponse = await axios.get(`/employees/user/${reaction.user}`);
        return {
          name: userResponse.data.employee 
            ? `${userResponse.data.employee.personalInfo.firstName} ${userResponse.data.employee.personalInfo.lastName}`
            : userResponse.data.user?.email || 'Unknown',
          employeeId: userResponse.data.employee?.employeeId || 'N/A',
          type: reaction.type,
          reactedAt: reaction.reactedAt
        };
      });
      details[announcement._id] = await Promise.all(reactionPromises);
    }
  }
  setReactionDetails(details);
};
```

#### 3. UI for Reaction Details
```javascript
<Typography 
  variant="caption" 
  color="text.secondary"
  sx={{ cursor: 'pointer', '&:hover': { color: 'primary.main' } }}
  onClick={() => toggleReactionsExpand(announcement._id)}
>
  {reactionCount} reactions
  {expandedReactions === announcement._id ? ' ▲' : ' ▼'}
</Typography>

{expandedReactions === announcement._id && (
  <Box sx={{ mt: 1, p: 1, bgcolor: '#f5f5f5', borderRadius: 1 }}>
    {reactionDetails[announcement._id].map((reactor) => (
      <Box sx={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: 0.5 }}>
        <Typography>{getReactionIcon(reactor.type)}</Typography>
        <PersonIcon />
        <Typography>
          {reactor.name} ({reactor.employeeId}) - {reactor.type}
        </Typography>
      </Box>
    ))}
  </Box>
)}
```
