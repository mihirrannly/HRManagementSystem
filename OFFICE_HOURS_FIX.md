# Office Hours Fix - 10 AM to 7 PM

## ✅ FIXED: Late Attendance Calculation Updated

### Issue Reported
The system was marking employees as "Late" even when checking in before 10 AM, because the office hours were incorrectly configured as 9 AM - 6 PM instead of 10 AM - 7 PM.

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Updated `server/routes/attendance.js`

#### Line 52-53: OFFICE_CONFIG
```javascript
// Before:
workingHours: {
  start: '09:00',
  end: '18:00'
}

// After:
workingHours: {
  start: '10:00', // Office starts at 10 AM
  end: '19:00' // Office ends at 7 PM
}
```

#### Line 1942: Fixed Hardcoded Time in Rannkly Import
```javascript
// Before:
const workStart = moment(attendanceDate).hour(9).minute(0);

// After:
const workStart = moment.tz(moment(attendanceDate).format('YYYY-MM-DD') + ' ' + OFFICE_CONFIG.workingHours.start, OFFICE_CONFIG.timezone);
```

### 2. Updated `server/routes/faceDetection.js`

#### Line 44-45: OFFICE_CONFIG
```javascript
// Before:
workingHours: {
  start: '09:00',
  end: '18:00'
}

// After:
workingHours: {
  start: '10:00', // Office starts at 10 AM
  end: '19:00' // Office ends at 7 PM
}
```

## 🎯 Impact

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Check-in at 9:00 AM → ✅ **On Time**
- ❌ Check-in at 9:30 AM → ✅ **On Time**
- ✅ Check-in at 10:01 AM → ❌ **Late by 1 min**

### After Fix:
- ✅ Check-in at 9:00 AM → ✅ **On Time** (Early!)
- ✅ Check-in at 9:30 AM → ✅ **On Time** (Early!)
- ✅ Check-in at 10:00 AM → ✅ **On Time**
- ✅ Check-in at 10:01 AM → ❌ **Late by 1 min** ← Correct!
- ✅ Check-in at 10:15 AM → ❌ **Late by 15 min**

### Check-out Changes:
- ✅ Check-out before 7 PM (19:00) → Early Departure warning
- ✅ Check-out at 7 PM (19:00) or after → Full day completed

---

## 📋 What Gets Fixed

### 1. **Real-time Check-in/Check-out**
- When employees check in via web or face detection
- Late status calculated based on 10 AM
- Early departure calculated based on 7 PM (or flexible end time)

### 2. **Attendance Import**
- When importing attendance from Rannkly reports
- When importing attendance from Excel files
- Previously hardcoded to 9 AM, now uses 10 AM

### 3. **My Attendance Records**
- Historical attendance records display
- Late status indicators
- Late minutes calculation

### 4. **Flexible Working Hours**
- System allows 9-hour workday
- If employee checks in at 10:15 AM, they can leave at 7:15 PM
- No early departure penalty if completing 9 hours

---

## 🚀 How to Verify the Fix

### Test 1: Check Current Office Hours
1. Go to Employee Dashboard
2. Click "Check In" or "Check Out"
3. System should show:
   - Office Hours: 10:00 AM - 7:00 PM
   - Current time in IST

### Test 2: Check-in Before 10 AM
1. If current time is before 10 AM:
   - Check in
   - Should show "On Time"
   - No late indicator

### Test 3: Check-in After 10 AM
1. If current time is after 10 AM (e.g., 10:15 AM):
   - Check in
   - Should show "Late by X minutes"
   - Late indicator appears

### Test 4: View Attendance Records
1. Go to "My Attendance Records" section
2. Check historical records
3. Only records checked in after 10:00 AM should show "Late"
4. Records checked in at 9:30 AM should show "On Time"

### Test 5: Import Attendance
1. Import attendance with check-in at 9:45 AM
2. Should be marked as "On Time"
3. Import attendance with check-in at 10:05 AM
4. Should be marked as "Late by 5 min"

## 📊 System Behavior

### Late Calculation Logic:
```javascript
// Office start time: 10:00 AM
const workStart = moment.tz('YYYY-MM-DD 10:00', 'Asia/Kolkata');

// Check-in time: User's actual check-in time
const checkInTime = moment.tz(actualTime, 'Asia/Kolkata');

// Is Late?
const isLate = checkInTime.isAfter(workStart);

// How many minutes late?
const lateMinutes = isLate ? checkInTime.diff(workStart, 'minutes') : 0;
```

### Flexible End Time Logic:
```javascript
// If employee checks in at 10:15 AM
const checkInTime = moment('10:15', 'HH:mm');

// They can leave at 7:15 PM (9 hours later)
const flexibleEndTime = checkInTime.add(9, 'hours'); // 19:15

// No early departure penalty before 7:15 PM
```

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [x] Updated OFFICE_CONFIG in attendance.js
- [x] Updated OFFICE_CONFIG in faceDetection.js
- [x] Fixed hardcoded 9 AM in Rannkly import
- [x] Backend server restarted
- [ ] User to verify check-in behavior
- [ ] User to verify attendance records
- [ ] User to verify imported attendance
- [ ] User to verify face detection attendance

## 🎉 Result

**Office hours are now correctly set to 10 AM - 7 PM!**

Employees checking in before 10 AM will be marked as **On Time**, and only those checking in after 10 AM will be marked as **Late**.

**Please refresh your browser and test the check-in functionality to verify the fix!** 🚀

---

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Refresh browser** (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R)
2. **Test check-in** before 10 AM (should be On Time)
3. **Test check-in** after 10 AM (should be Late if after 10:00)
4. **Check attendance records** to verify late indicators are correct
5. **Verify** that historical records now show correct late status

If any records still show incorrect late status, it might be cached data. The system will calculate correctly for all new check-ins from now on!
