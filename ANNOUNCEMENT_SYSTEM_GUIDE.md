## Troubleshooting

### Announcements Not Showing

**Problem**: Users can't see announcements on dashboard

**Solutions**:
1. Check announcement is active (`isActive: true`)
2. Verify date range (within start/end dates)
3. Check targeting matches user profile
4. Ensure user is logged in and authenticated

### Can't Vote on Poll

**Problem**: Vote button doesn't work or shows error

**Solutions**:
1. Check if already voted (single-choice polls)
2. Verify poll is still active
3. Ensure user is authenticated
4. Check network connection

### Management Page Not Accessible

**Problem**: Can't access `/announcements` page

**Solutions**:
1. Verify user has Admin or HR role
2. Check authentication token is valid
3. Clear browser cache and reload
4. Verify route is registered in App.jsx

## Future Enhancements (Potential)

- Email notifications for urgent announcements
- Comments on announcements
- File attachments support
- Rich text editor for content
- Announcement templates
- Analytics and insights
- Export poll results
- Scheduled auto-posting
- Multi-language support
- Announcement categories customization

## Security Considerations

- All routes require authentication
- Management routes restricted to Admin/HR
- User can only vote once per poll (single-choice)
- Visibility automatically filtered by targeting
- Reactions and votes are user-specific
- No sensitive data exposed in API responses
