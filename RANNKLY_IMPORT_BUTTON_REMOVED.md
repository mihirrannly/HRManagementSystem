## 🎯 Changes Made

### File: `client/src/pages/Attendance/Attendance.jsx`

#### 1. **Removed "Import Rannkly Report" Button**
**Before:**
```jsx
<Button
  variant="contained"
  size="small"
  startIcon={<CloudUploadIcon />}
  onClick={() => navigate('/attendance/import-rannkly')}
  sx={{
    background: 'linear-gradient(45deg, #667eea 30%, #764ba2 90%)',
    ...
  }}
>
  Import Rannkly Report
</Button>
<Button
  variant="outlined"
  size="small"
  startIcon={<FileUploadIcon />}
  onClick={() => navigate('/attendance/import')}
  ...
>
  Import Simple Format
</Button>
```

**After:**
```jsx
<Button
  variant="outlined"
  size="small"
  startIcon={<FileUploadIcon />}
  onClick={() => navigate('/attendance/import')}
  ...
>
  Import Attendance
</Button>
```

#### 2. **Cleaned Up Unused Import**
Removed unused `CloudUploadIcon` from imports:
```jsx
// Before:
import {
  ...
  CloudUpload as CloudUploadIcon,
  FileUpload as FileUploadIcon
} from '@mui/icons-material';

// After:
import {
  ...
  FileUpload as FileUploadIcon
} from '@mui/icons-material';
```

#### 3. **Simplified Button Text**
Changed button label from "Import Simple Format" to "Import Attendance" for clarity.

### Import Section:
```
[Import Attendance] ← Single, clean button
```

- ❌ Unused gradient button

**What remains:**
- ✅ Single "Import Attendance" button

## 🎨 UI Impact

### Before:
```
[Import Rannkly Report] [Import Simple Format] | Last updated: 15:30:00
    (Purple gradient)        (Outlined)
```

### After:
```
[Import Attendance] | Last updated: 15:30:00
    (Outlined)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Less cluttered interface

## 🚀 How to Verify

2. **Go to Attendance Management**
3. **Look at top-right controls**
4. **Verify:**
   - Only ONE import button is visible
   - Button says "Import Attendance"
   - No "Import Rannkly Report" button

## 📝 Related Files Not Deleted

The following files still exist but are not linked from the UI:
- `client/src/pages/Attendance/RannklyAttendanceImport.jsx`
- Route: `/attendance/import-rannkly`

**Note:** These files are kept in case they're needed in the future, but they're not accessible from the UI anymore.

If you want to completely remove the Rannkly import feature:
1. Delete `RannklyAttendanceImport.jsx`
2. Remove the route from `App.jsx`
3. Delete related backend endpoints if any
