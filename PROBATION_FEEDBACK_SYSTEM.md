# Probation Feedback System - Complete Implementation Guide

## 📋 Overview

The Probation Feedback System is an automated solution that triggers feedback forms to both employees and their managers when an employee completes their 3-month (90-day) probation period. This system ensures structured feedback collection and facilitates informed decisions about employee confirmation.

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ **Multi-Channel Notifications**:
  - In-app notifications
  - Email notifications (with beautiful HTML templates)
  - Reminder notifications after 3 days
- ✅ **Comprehensive Assessment**:
  - Learning & Development tracking
  - Performance evaluation
  - Behavioral assessment
  - Future planning
- ✅ **Manager Recommendations**: Confirm, Extend, or Terminate
- ✅ **HR Review System**: Final decision and comments

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend Components

#### 1. **Model** (`server/models/ProbationFeedback.js`)
```javascript
ProbationFeedback {
  employee: ObjectId
  employeeId: String
  employeeName: String

  joiningDate: Date
  probationEndDate: Date
  
  employeeFeedback: {
    submitted: Boolean
    submittedAt: Date
    // Learning & Development
    // Job Performance
    // Work Environment
    // Future Outlook
  }
  
  managerFeedback: {
    submitted: Boolean
    submittedAt: Date
    // Performance Evaluation (10-point scales)
    // Behavioral Assessment (10-point scales)
    // Overall Assessment (text fields)
    // Recommendation (confirm/extend/terminate)
    // Future Planning
  }
  
  status: Enum [pending, employee_completed, manager_completed, both_completed, reviewed]
  hrReview: { ... }
}
```

## 🔄 Workflow

### 1. Probation Completion Detection
```
Day 90 (9:00 AM) → Scheduler checks for completing employees
                  ↓
            Creates ProbationFeedback record
                  ↓
            Sends notifications to:
            - Employee (self-assessment)
            - Manager (evaluation)
                  ↓
            Sends email notifications
```

### 2. Employee Submission

   ```

2. **Trigger Scheduler Manually**
   ```javascript
   const probationScheduler = require('./services/probationScheduler');
   await probationScheduler.runProbationCheck();
   ```

3. **Check Notifications**
   - Verify in-app notifications appear
   - Check email inbox for employee
   - Check email inbox for manager

4. **Test Form Submissions**
   - Log in as employee → Complete feedback
   - Log in as manager → Complete assessment
   - Log in as HR → Review and make decision

### Automated Testing
Consider adding:
- Unit tests for model methods
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for complete workflow

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Emails Not Sending**
   - Check `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` in .env
   - Verify email service configuration in `emailService.js`
   - Check console logs for email errors

2. **Scheduler Not Running**
   - Check if scheduler started: `probationScheduler.getStatus()`
   - Verify cron expression syntax
   - Check server logs for scheduler errors

3. **Notifications Not Appearing**
   - Verify Notification model is properly imported
   - Check notification creation logs
   - Verify user has permission to view notifications

4. **Wrong Probation End Date**
   - Verify employee joining date is correct
   - Check probation period calculation (90 days)
   - Ensure timezone handling is correct
