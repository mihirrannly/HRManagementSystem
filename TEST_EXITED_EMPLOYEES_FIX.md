# Testing the Exited Employees Filter Fix

## Quick Test Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Exit an Employee

1. **Navigate to Exit Management module**
   - Go to Organization → Exit Management
   
2. **Create a test exit:**
   - Click "Create Exit Record"
   - Select a test employee (choose one that's currently visible in employee lists)
   - Fill in required fields:
     - Exit Type: Resignation
     - Last Working Date: Today or past date
     - Reason: "Testing exit process"
   - Click "Create"

3. **Approve the exit:**
   - Open the newly created exit record
   - Complete required clearances (or skip for testing)
   - Click "Approve Exit" button
   - ✅ **This should set `employmentInfo.isActive = false`**

### ✅ Step 2: Verify Employee is Hidden

**Check these pages - the exited employee should NOT appear:**

1. **Employees Page**
   - Navigate to: Employees
   - Search for the employee
   - Result: ❌ Employee should NOT be found

2. **Organization Module - Employees Tab**
   - Navigate to: Organization → Employees
   - Look through the employee list
   - Result: ❌ Employee should NOT appear

3. **Dashboard**
   - Navigate to: Dashboard
   - Check any employee counters/widgets
   - Result: Employee count should be reduced by 1

4. **Any Employee Dropdowns**
   - Try to assign something to an employee
   - Open the employee dropdown
   - Result: ❌ Exited employee should NOT be in the list

### ✅ Step 3: Verify in Database (Optional)

**Using MongoDB or your database tool:**

```javascript
// Should show isActive: false for the exited employee
db.employees.find({ 
  employeeId: "CODR123" // Replace with your test employee ID
})
```

**Expected result:**
```javascript
{
  employeeId: "CODR123",
  employmentInfo: {
    isActive: false,  // ✅ This should be false
    terminationDate: ISODate("2025-10-13T00:00:00.000Z"),
    terminationReason: "Testing exit process"
  }
}
```

## API Testing

### Test the API directly:

**1. Get all employees (should return only active):**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/employees
```

**Expected:** Should NOT include the exited employee

**2. Get inactive employees explicitly:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/employees?isActive=false
```

**Expected:** Should ONLY return the exited employee(s)

**3. Using browser console:**
```javascript
// Should return only active employees
const response = await axios.get('/api/employees');
console.log('Active employees:', response.data.employees.length);
console.log('Employee IDs:', response.data.employees.map(e => e.employeeId));

// Should return only inactive employees
const inactiveResponse = await axios.get('/api/employees?isActive=false');
console.log('Inactive employees:', inactiveResponse.data.employees.length);
console.log('Exited employee IDs:', inactiveResponse.data.employees.map(e => e.employeeId));
```

## Rollback (If Needed)

### To reactivate an exited employee:

**Using MongoDB:**
```javascript
db.employees.updateOne(
  { employeeId: "CODR123" },
  { 
    $set: { 
      "employmentInfo.isActive": true,
      "employmentInfo.terminationDate": null,
      "employmentInfo.terminationReason": null
    }
  }
)
```

**Or via API (if endpoint exists):**
```bash
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"employmentInfo": {"isActive": true}}' \
  http://localhost:5000/api/employees/EMPLOYEE_ID
```

## Expected Behavior Summary

| Action | Before Fix | After Fix |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| View Employees page | Shows all (active + inactive) | Shows only active ✅ |
| Search for exited employee | Found ❌ | Not found ✅ |
| Employee dropdown | Includes exited ❌ | Excludes exited ✅ |
| Birthday notifications | Sent to exited ❌ | Not sent to exited ✅ |
| Anniversary notifications | Sent to exited ❌ | Not sent to exited ✅ |
| Team member lists | Includes exited ❌ | Excludes exited ✅ |
| Reports | Includes exited ❌ | Excludes exited ✅ |

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Exited employee still appears
**Solution:** Clear browser cache and reload, or verify the exit was approved (not just created)

### Issue: Need to see exited employees for reports
**Solution:** Implement a toggle in the frontend:
```javascript
const [showInactive, setShowInactive] = useState(false);

const fetchEmployees = async () => {
  const url = showInactive 
    ? '/api/employees?isActive=false' 
    : '/api/employees';
  const response = await axios.get(url);
  // ...
};
```

### Issue: Employee was exited by mistake
**Solution:** Use the rollback MongoDB command above to reactivate

## Success Criteria

✅ Exited employees don't appear in employee lists
✅ Exited employees don't appear in dropdowns/selectors
✅ Employee count reduces when someone exits
✅ Active employees still work normally
✅ Exit management process completes successfully
✅ No errors in browser console or server logs

## Notes

- The fix is backward-compatible - no frontend changes required
- All existing API calls will automatically exclude inactive employees
- The change only affects the default behavior - you can still query inactive employees if needed
- Exit Management module has its own "Exited Employees" tab to view all historical exits

**If all tests pass, the fix is working correctly! 🎉**
