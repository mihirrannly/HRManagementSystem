# Work Anniversary Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend API Endpoint ✓
**File:** `server/routes/employees.js`

Created a new endpoint `/api/employees/anniversaries` that:
- Is accessible to all authenticated users
- Fetches all active employees with joining dates
- Calculates years of service
- Filters employees with at least 1 year of service
- Separates anniversaries into "This Month" and "Upcoming" (next month)
- Returns sorted data by anniversary date

### 2. Frontend - Employee Dashboard ✓
**File:** `client/src/pages/Dashboard/EmployeeDashboard.jsx`

Added:
- State management for anniversaries
- `fetchAnniversaries()` function to call the API
- Two beautiful cards displaying:
  - 🎉 **This Month's Anniversaries** (Pink theme)
  - 📅 **Upcoming Anniversaries** (Blue theme)

### 3. Frontend - Admin Dashboard ✓
**File:** `client/src/pages/Dashboard/Dashboard.jsx`

Added the same anniversary cards for admin/HR users with identical functionality.

## 🎨 UI Features

### Card Design
- **Gradient backgrounds** for visual appeal
- **Avatar with initials** for each employee
- **Employee name** prominently displayed
- **Years of service** description
- **Anniversary date** in readable format
- **Badge** showing years (e.g., "5Y")
- **Smooth hover animations**
- **Responsive design** (cards stack on mobile)

### Color Schemes
- **This Month:** Pink gradient with `#d81b60` accents
- **Upcoming:** Blue gradient with `#0288d1` accents

## 📊 What You'll See on the Dashboard

When you log in and navigate to the Dashboard, you'll see:

1. **If there are anniversaries this month:**
   ```
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ 🎉 This Month's Anniversaries          │
   ├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
   │  RK  Rajesh Kumar                    5Y │

   └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **On Dashboard Load:**
   - The `fetchAnniversaries()` function is called
   - API request goes to `/api/employees/anniversaries`
   - Server calculates current month and next month anniversaries
   - Data is returned and stored in state

2. **Display Logic:**
   - Cards only show if there are anniversaries to display
   - Up to 5 upcoming anniversaries are shown
   - All current month anniversaries are shown

3. **Real-Time Data:**
   - Uses actual employee joining dates from the database
   - Automatically updates based on the current date
   - No manual configuration needed

## 🚀 How to View

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   ./start-servers.sh
   ```
   Or:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Login to the system:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Login with any valid user credentials

3. **View the Dashboard:**
   - The anniversary cards will appear automatically below the stat cards
   - If no anniversaries exist for current/next month, the cards won't show

## 📝 Example Scenario

**Today's Date:** October 7, 2025

**Employee: Rajesh Kumar**
- Joining Date: October 15, 2020

**Employee: Sarah Khan**
