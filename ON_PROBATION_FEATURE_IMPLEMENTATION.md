# On Probation Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implemented an automatic probation status calculation system that identifies and displays employees who haven't completed three months from their date of joining. The system automatically calculates probation periods and displays all employees currently in probation on the dashboard.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend Changes

#### A. New API Endpoint (`/api/employees/on-probation`)
**File:** `server/routes/employees.js`

Created a dedicated endpoint that:
- Automatically calculates which employees are within their first 3 months
- Filters based on `dateOfJoining` field
- Returns detailed information including:
  - Employee ID, name, designation, department
  - Joining date and calculated probation end date
  - Days remaining in probation period
  - Days completed in probation

**Key Features:**
- Uses date math to find employees who joined within the last 3 months
- Automatically calculates probation end date (joining date + 3 months)
- Sorts employees by days remaining (ascending)
- Only includes active employees

**API Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 5,
  "employees": [
    {
      "_id": "...",
      "employeeId": "EMP001",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "designation": "Software Engineer",
      "department": "Engineering",
      "joiningDate": "2025-08-13T00:00:00.000Z",
      "probationEndDate": "2025-11-13T00:00:00.000Z",
      "daysRemaining": 61,
      "daysCompleted": 29,
      "profilePicture": {...}
    }
  ]
}
```

#### B. Employee Model Enhancements
**File:** `server/models/Employee.js`

Added virtual fields for automatic probation calculation:
1. **`isOnProbation`** - Boolean indicating if employee is currently on probation
2. **`probationCalculatedEndDate`** - Auto-calculated probation end date
3. **`probationDaysRemaining`** - Days remaining in probation period

These virtual fields can be accessed directly on employee objects:
```javascript
const employee = await Employee.findById(id);
console.log(employee.isOnProbation); // true/false
console.log(employee.probationDaysRemaining); // e.g., 45
```

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### A. Dashboard Data Fetching
**File:** `client/src/pages/Dashboard/Dashboard.jsx`

Updated the `EmployeeOverviewSection` component to:
- Fetch probation data from the new `/employees/on-probation` endpoint
- Replace manual probation filtering with API-driven data
- Display probation employees with enhanced information

**Before:**
```javascript
// Manual filtering based on probationEndDate field
const probationEmps = employees.filter(emp => {
  const probationEndDate = emp.employmentInfo?.probationEndDate;
  return probationEndDate && new Date(probationEndDate) >= currentDate;
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Use dedicated API endpoint
const probationRes = await axios.get('/employees/on-probation');
if (probationRes.data.success && probationRes.data.employees) {
  setProbation(probationRes.data.employees);
}
```

#### B. Enhanced Probation Card Display
**File:** `client/src/pages/Dashboard/Dashboard.jsx`

Updated the "On Probation" card in the Employee Overview section to show:
- Employee name, designation, and department
- Days remaining in probation (visual chip badge)
- Joining date
- Better visual hierarchy and styling

**Display Features:**
- Title changed from "Probation" to "On Probation" for clarity
- Shows count of employees on probation
- Each employee card displays:
  - Full name (prominent)
  - Designation
  - Department
  - Days remaining badge (orange chip)
  - Joining date with formatted display

## How It Works

### Automatic Calculation Logic

1. **Probation Period:** 3 months (90 days) from date of joining
2. **Calculation Method:**
   ```javascript
   const threeMonthsAgo = new Date();
   threeMonthsAgo.setMonth(threeMonthsAgo.getMonth() - 3);
   
   // Find employees who joined after this date
   employees.find({
     'employmentInfo.dateOfJoining': { 
       $gte: threeMonthsAgo,
       $lte: currentDate
     }
   })
   ```

3. **Days Remaining:**
   ```javascript
   const probationEndDate = new Date(joiningDate);
   probationEndDate.setMonth(probationEndDate.getMonth() + 3);
   const daysRemaining = Math.ceil((probationEndDate - currentDate) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
   ```

### Data Flow

```
User Opens Dashboard
    ↓
fetchOverviewData() is called
    ↓
Parallel API calls including /employees/on-probation
    ↓
Backend queries employees where:
  - isActive = true
  - dateOfJoining is within last 3 months
    ↓
Backend calculates:
  - Probation end date
  - Days remaining
  - Days completed
    ↓
Frontend receives enriched data
    ↓
Display in "On Probation" card
```

## Benefits

1. **Automatic:** No manual tracking of probation periods
2. **Real-time:** Always up-to-date based on current date
3. **Accurate:** Uses exact date calculations (not approximations)
4. **Comprehensive:** Shows all relevant information in one place
5. **Visual:** Easy to see at a glance who is on probation and time remaining
6. **Scalable:** Handles any number of employees efficiently

## Where to See Changes

1. **Main Dashboard** → Employee Overview Section → "On Probation" Card
   - Shows count of employees currently on probation
   - Lists each employee with days remaining
   - Sorted by days remaining (employees ending probation soon appear first)

2. **Employee Data** → Virtual fields available on any employee object
   - `employee.isOnProbation`
   - `employee.probationCalculatedEndDate`
   - `employee.probationDaysRemaining`

## Technical Notes

### Date Handling
- All dates stored in UTC in database
- Frontend displays dates in user's local timezone using moment.js
- Probation period calculated using calendar months (not fixed 90 days)

### Performance
- API endpoint uses MongoDB indexes on `dateOfJoining` field
- Efficient query with date range filter
- Lean queries for better performance
- Virtual fields calculated on-demand (not stored)

### Compatibility
- Works with existing employee records
- Only requires `dateOfJoining` field to be populated
- Backward compatible with manual `probationEndDate` field
- Active employees filter ensures only current staff shown

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Notifications:** Send alerts when probation period is ending
2. **Reports:** Probation completion reports
3. **Configurable Period:** Allow HR to set custom probation periods (3, 6 months)
4. **Status Updates:** Automatic status change when probation ends
5. **Performance Reviews:** Link probation to review cycles
6. **Email Reminders:** Notify managers before probation ends

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Add test employee:**
   ```javascript
   // Employee who joined 2 months ago (should appear on probation)
   {
     employmentInfo: {
       dateOfJoining: new Date('2025-08-13'), // 2 months ago
       isActive: true
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Check dashboard:**
   - Navigate to Dashboard
   - Look for "On Probation" card in Employee Overview section
   - Verify employee appears with correct days remaining

3. **API Testing:**
   ```bash
   # Get probation employees
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/employees/on-probation \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
   ```

## Files Modified

1. `server/routes/employees.js` - Added `/on-probation` endpoint
2. `server/models/Employee.js` - Added virtual fields for probation
3. `client/src/pages/Dashboard/Dashboard.jsx` - Updated data fetching and display

## Dependencies

No new dependencies required. Uses existing:
- Express.js (backend routing)
- Mongoose (MongoDB queries and virtuals)
- Moment.js (date formatting in frontend)
- Material-UI (dashboard components)
