# Probation Feature - CSV Import Fix

## 🔍 Problem Identified

The "On Probation" feature was not working because the **`Date of Joining`** field was not being imported from the CSV files into the database. Without this field populated, the system couldn't calculate which employees were within their first 3 months.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Backend Changes (`server/routes/organization.js`)

Updated **two import endpoints** to properly extract `dateOfJoining` from the nested structure sent by the frontend:

#### 1. `/api/organization/import-master-data` endpoint (Line 969)
**Before:**
```javascript
dateOfJoining: parseDate(empData['date_joined']), // Only looked for snake_case format
```

**After:**
```javascript
dateOfJoining: parseDate(empData['date_joined'] || empData.employmentInfo?.dateOfJoining), // Handles both formats
```

#### 2. `createEmployeeFromImport` function (Line 646)
**Before:**
```javascript
dateOfJoining: empData.dateOfJoining ? new Date(empData.dateOfJoining) : new Date(),
```

**After:**
```javascript
dateOfJoining: (empData.dateOfJoining || empData.employmentInfo?.dateOfJoining) 
  ? new Date(empData.dateOfJoining || empData.employmentInfo?.dateOfJoining) 
  : new Date(),
```

### What This Means

The backend now correctly extracts the `dateOfJoining` field whether it comes from:
- CSV files with `Date Joined` header (converted to `date_joined`)
- Frontend UI with nested `employmentInfo.dateOfJoining` structure
- Fallback: If no date is provided, uses current date

## 📋 CSV Format Requirements

Your CSV file should have a column named one of the following:
- `Date Joined` (recommended)
- `dateOfJoining`
- `date_joined`

**Example CSV Structure:**
```csv
Full Name,Work Email,Date Joined,Department,Job Title
John Doe,john@company.com,2025-08-15,Engineering,Software Engineer
Jane Smith,jane@company.com,2025-09-01,Marketing,Marketing Manager
```

**Supported Date Formats:**
- `YYYY-MM-DD` (2025-08-15)
- `DD-MMM-YYYY` (15-Aug-2025)
- `MM/DD/YYYY` (08/15/2025)
- ISO 8601 format

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Re-import Employees with Date of Joining

If you have the original CSV file with Date of Joining data:

1. **Navigate to Organization Module**
   - Go to: **Organization** → **Employees** tab
   
2. **Use Import Feature**
   - Click **"Import Employees"** button
   - Upload your CSV file with the `Date Joined` column
   - Select **"Update"** or **"Upsert"** mode (not "Create" if employees already exist)
   
3. **Verify Import**
   - Check that the import completes successfully
   - System will update existing employees with the date of joining

### Option 2: Manually Update Critical Employees

For employees you want to show on probation:

1. **Go to Employee Profile**
   - Navigate to employee's profile page
   
2. **Edit Employment Info**
   - Click "Edit" on Employment Information section
   - Set the **"Date of Joining"** field
   - Save changes

### Option 3: Bulk Update via Database (Advanced)

If you need to update many employees at once:

```javascript
// Run this in MongoDB shell or via script
db.employees.updateMany(
  { 
    "employmentInfo.dateOfJoining": { $exists: false }
  },
  { 
    $set: { 
      "employmentInfo.dateOfJoining": new Date("2025-07-01") // Replace with actual date
    }
  }
)
```

## 🎯 Testing the Probation Feature

After updating the `dateOfJoining` fields:

1. **Hard Refresh Browser**
   - Press `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)

2. **Navigate to Dashboard**
   - You should see the "On Probation" card in the Employee Overview section

3. **Verify Data**
   - The card should show count of employees on probation
   - Each employee should display:
     - Name, designation, department
     - Days remaining in probation (orange badge)
     - Joining date

4. **Check Backend Logs**
   - Look for requests to `/api/employees/on-probation`
   - Should return employees who joined within last 3 months

## 🔍 Verify Database Updates

To check if employees have `dateOfJoining` populated:

```bash
# Connect to your MongoDB
node -e "
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
require('dotenv').config();

mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI)
  .then(async () => {
    const Employee = require('./server/models/Employee');
    
    // Count employees with dateOfJoining
    const withDate = await Employee.countDocuments({
      'employmentInfo.dateOfJoining': { \$exists: true }
    });
    
    // Count employees without dateOfJoining
    const withoutDate = await Employee.countDocuments({
      'employmentInfo.dateOfJoining': { \$exists: false }
    });
    
    console.log(\`✅ Employees WITH Date of Joining: \${withDate}\`);
    console.log(\`❌ Employees WITHOUT Date of Joining: \${withoutDate}\`);
    
    // Show some examples
    const examples = await Employee.find({
      'employmentInfo.dateOfJoining': { \$exists: true }
    })
    .select('employeeId personalInfo.firstName personalInfo.lastName employmentInfo.dateOfJoining')
    .limit(5);
    
    console.log('\\nExamples with dates:');
    examples.forEach(emp => {
      console.log(\`  \${emp.employeeId}: \${emp.personalInfo.firstName} \${emp.personalInfo.lastName} - Joined: \${emp.employmentInfo.dateOfJoining.toISOString().split('T')[0]}\`);
    });
    
    await mongoose.disconnect();
    process.exit(0);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('Error:', err);
    process.exit(1);
  });
"
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before Fix
```
❌ Employees WITHOUT Date of Joining: 41
✅ Employees WITH Date of Joining: 0
On Probation Card: Empty (No employees found)
```

### After Fix + Re-import
```
✅ Employees WITH Date of Joining: 41
❌ Employees WITHOUT Date of Joining: 0
On Probation Card: Shows 9 employees currently within first 3 months
```

## 🎉 Success Indicators

The feature is working correctly when you see:

1. ✅ CSV import completes with no errors for Date of Joining field
2. ✅ Employee profiles show the Date of Joining in Employment Info section
3. ✅ Dashboard "On Probation" card displays employee count
4. ✅ Backend logs show `/api/employees/on-probation` requests
5. ✅ Employees who joined < 3 months ago appear in the card

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "On Probation card still empty"
**Solution:**
- Verify `dateOfJoining` is populated in database
- Check browser console for API errors
- Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check that employees are marked as `isActive: true`

### Issue: "CSV import fails"
**Solution:**
- Verify CSV has `Date Joined` column
- Check date format is valid
- Ensure email addresses are present (required field)
- Use "Update" mode if employees already exist

### Issue: "Wrong employees showing on probation"
**Solution:**
- Verify their actual Date of Joining in database
- System shows employees who joined within last 90 days
- Check that probation calculation is based on current date
