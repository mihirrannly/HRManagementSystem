# ✅ Network Error Fixed!

## 🔧 Issues Found & Fixed

### **Issue 1: Wrong Backend Port in Proxy**
**Problem:** Vite proxy was configured for port `5001`, but backend is running on port `5000`

**Fixed:** Updated `client/vite.config.js` to point to port `5000`

```javascript
proxy: {
  '/api': {
    target: 'http://localhost:5000',  // ✅ Changed from 5001 to 5000
    ...
  }
}
```

### **Issue 2: Bypassing Proxy**
**Problem:** MonthlyAttendanceGrid was using full URL which bypassed the proxy

**Fixed:** Changed to use relative path
```javascript
// Before (bypasses proxy):
axios.get(`${API_URL}/api/attendance/calendar`, ...)

// After (uses proxy):
axios.get('/api/attendance/calendar', ...)  // ✅ Relative path
```

## 🚀 How to Apply the Fix

### **Step 1: Stop Current Dev Server**
In your terminal where the dev server is running, press:
```
Ctrl + C
```

### **Step 2: Restart Dev Server**
```bash
cd "/Users/mihir/Documents/Rannkly HR Management/client"
npm run dev
```

### **Step 3: Refresh Browser**
In your browser, refresh the page:
```
Cmd + Shift + R  (Mac)
Ctrl + Shift + R  (Windows/Linux)
```

---

## ✅ Verification

After restarting:

1. **Go to Attendance page:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/attendance
   ```

2. **Click "Monthly Grid" tab**

3. **You should see:**
   - Loading spinner briefly
   - Then the monthly attendance grid with all employees
   - No network errors in console

## 🔍 What Was Happening

**Before Fix:**
```
Browser (localhost:5173)
    ↓
Trying to connect to: http://localhost:5000/api/attendance/calendar
    ↓
❌ CORS Error / Network Error (no proxy, direct connection blocked)
```

**After Fix:**
```
Browser (localhost:5173)
    ↓
Request to: /api/attendance/calendar (relative path)
    ↓
Vite Proxy intercepts and forwards to: http://localhost:5000/api/attendance/calendar
    ↓
✅ Backend receives request with proper headers
    ↓
✅ Response returns successfully
```

## 📝 Files Modified

1. ✅ `client/vite.config.js` - Fixed proxy port (5001 → 5000)
2. ✅ `client/src/pages/Attendance/MonthlyAttendanceGrid.jsx` - Use relative path

---

## 🎯 Why This Happens

**Vite Proxy:**
- Development tool to avoid CORS issues
- Intercepts requests starting with `/api`
- Forwards them to the backend server
- Must match the actual backend port

**Relative vs Absolute URLs:**
- Relative (`/api/...`) → Uses proxy ✅
- Absolute (`http://localhost:5000/api/...`) → Bypasses proxy, causes CORS ❌

## 💡 Quick Restart Commands

### If dev server is running:
1. **Focus terminal**
2. **Press:** `Ctrl + C`
3. **Run:** `npm run dev`

### If unsure if it's running:
```bash
# Find and kill any process on port 5173
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9

# Start fresh
cd "/Users/mihir/Documents/Rannkly HR Management/client"
npm run dev
```

---

## ✅ Expected Result

After restart, the Monthly Grid tab should:
- Load without errors
- Show all employees
- Display attendance data for the current month
- Allow month navigation
- Enable Excel export

---

## 🆘 If Still Having Issues

### Check Backend is Running:
```bash
lsof -ti:5000
```
Should return a process ID number.

### Check Frontend is Running:
```bash
lsof -ti:5173
```
Should return a process ID number.

### Check Browser Console:
Open DevTools (F12) and look for any errors.

### Verify Token:
Open DevTools → Application → Local Storage → Check `token` exists

---

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Just **restart the dev server** and the Monthly Grid will work perfectly! 🚀

**Commands:**
```bash
# In your client terminal:
